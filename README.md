Visual Nuts Exercises

Download the VisualNuts project code where you will have two main packages, exercise1 and exercise2. 

1. To test exercise 1, you need to run the class "PrintNumberMain" which is inside the package "exercise1 -> main".  Thinking to give the user flexibility, I have implemented it so that the user enters the value from the console between 1 and 100 initially or more.

2. To test exercise 2, you need to run the class "ReadCountriesJSONMain" which is inside the package "exercise2 -> main".  In this case a json file has been added to represent the countries and their spoken languages. When you run the class ReadCountriesJSONMain, the program will read it and give you the respective results of the question statement.
